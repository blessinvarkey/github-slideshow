- Sanatize and prepare data for modeling - Using descriptive statistics to understand data better
- Perform feature engineering
- Analyse and Visualise data for ML
- Standardize language and grammar
- Make sure the data is on the same scale (e.g. either in cm or km)
- Make sure a column doesnâ€™t include multiple features (e.g. temperature, cost, time all in one column!)
- Clean the data based on any outliers that may exist (points in dataset that lie at an abnormal distance from other values)
- Missing data needs to be handled
